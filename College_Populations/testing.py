# Project Goals: Create a visualization of the gender gap in colleges in the US
# Analyze the data based on geographic location
# Perform statistical analysis to determine whether or not there is a significant difference between the two genders
# Setup a sql database to store the data
# Create an interface that allows users to get the results they want, whether that be overall or of a specific college or region
 

# Work Plan
# Pull the data either using a single api, webscraping, or manually take the data from a variety of sources
    # Manually would make the program less useful to others and in the future

# Store the data in an sqlite database

# Clean and process the data
    # Possibly normalizing and modelling the data

# Analyze the difference based on the relationship between gender and geographic location
    # Create a variety of visualizations and build a written conclusion with a timestamp

# Create an interface that allows users to get the specific data and conclusion they want
